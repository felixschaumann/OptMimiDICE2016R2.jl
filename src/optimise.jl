    optimise_model(m::Model=get_model(); kwargs) -> m::Model, diagnostic::Dict
    
Optimise DICE2016R2 model instance `m` and return the optimised and updated model.

The model instance `m` is not a mandatory argument. In case it is not provided, the function will use a newly constructed model from [`OptMimiDICE2016R2.get_model`](@ref). It is worth manually passing a model instance if one wishes to optimise a modified version of DICE, e.g. with updated parameters or updated components.

## Keyword arguments:
- `n_objectives::Int=length(model_years)`: number of objectives, which corresponds to the number of time steps in the model
- `stop_time::Int=640`: time in seconds after which optimisation routine stops, passed to `NLopt.ftol_rel!`
- `tolerance::Float64=1e-6`: tolerance requirement passed to `NLopt.ftol_rel!`
- `optimization_algorithm::Symbol=:LN_SBPLX`: algorithm passed to `NLopt.ftol_rel!`

## Notes
- Importantly, this implementation of DICE2016R2 has no restrictions on NETs. A rate of emissions reduction `:MIU` of up to 1.2 is allowed throughout.
- The second return value is purely for diagnostic purposes and comes directly from the NLopt optimisation. In normal usage, it can be ignored.
